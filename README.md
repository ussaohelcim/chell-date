# chell-date
Game framework for the playdate console.

## How to use

- to import everything `import "chell-date"`
- you can also import individual modules

## Design

The design goal of this framework is to use static functions to handle everything. Something like raylib, love2d/lovr and the playdate api.  

## About contributing and using

This is a framework made **by me to me**. This means that **i'll probably not add a feature if you ask one**, but feel free to use and contributing with the code.
